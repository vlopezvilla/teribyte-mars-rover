# Water Analysis on Mars (W.A.M)
W.A.M. (Water Analysis on Mars) is a hybrid-mode rover that can be remotely controlled or operate autonomously with obstacle avoidance. It conducts water quality analysis to evaluate purity and assess the potential for vegetation/life on Martian terrain.

#### Project Overview 
- Navigate autonomously
- Detect and avoid obstacles
- Manual control for remote operation and data collection
- Analyze water purity on Mars terrain

##### Here is where I will be adding the file structure and directions to clone the repo.
